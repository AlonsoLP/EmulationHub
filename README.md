# Why this if exists EmulationStation?

I use EmulationStation in my Raspberry Pi 3. It's a fantastic front-end but when you want to make changes, you need to recompile the code and have some programming skills in C++, as well as having the development tools installed. For small changes it is quite tedious.

With Python, you only need a text editor to make changes and adapt it easily to your needs. Of course, a basic Python programming skills are essentials
