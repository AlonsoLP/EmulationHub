# Why this if exists EmulationStation?

I use EmulationStation in my Raspberry Pi 3 and PC. It's a fantastic front-end but when you want to make changes, you need to recompile the code and have some programming skills in C++, as well as having the development tools installed. For small changes it is quite tedious.

With Python, you only need a text editor to make changes and adapt it to your needs. Of course, basic Python programming skills are essentials.

The goal is to make it as similar as possible to EmulationStation (compatible with XML files), adding new features later.

I'll get it? Who knows... ;)

# The source code is... crap!

Yes, I know! This is my first project with Python and I'm learning the language and focused on functionality. As soon as the things works, I will organize, beautify and start doicumenting the source code.
